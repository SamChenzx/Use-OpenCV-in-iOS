Detection of  Moving Objects  with Non-stationary  Cameras in  5.8ms: Bringing Motion Detection to Your Mobile Device
================================================================================

This  Git repository  is an  implementation of  the paper  "Detection of  Moving
Objects with Non-stationary Cameras in  5.8ms: Bringing Motion Detection to Your
Mobile Device," Yi  et al, CVPRW 2013. These codes  should reproduce the results
presented in the paper, with a bit  of tuning on the parameters. The results may
differ a bit, as the variance update  equation was modified from the one used to
produce results of the paper. However, they should not differ significantly.

Important notice
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The code that we  ditributed earlier through e-mail had an  issue that it only
  gave good results with MS compiler. There was a bug that abs function was used
  instead of fabs (the floating point version)

* This repository is  not finalized. The current version cannot  save results as
  video,  and is  also  using  a very  old  open cv  style.   We  intend to  fix
  these. Also, there are some redundant relics from old codes.

* Again, this repository is build from a very old backup I had. You can go ahead
  an try,  as the detection  results won't change, but  bare in mind  that there
  might be compiler related issues.

How to compile and test
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simply use CMake and target the output directory as "build" in the same level as
"src". In command line this would be (from the project root folder)

> project_root >> mkdir build

> project_root >> cd build

> project_root/build >> cmake ..

> project_root/build >> make

Once it is built, you can try running

> project_root/build >> ./fastMCD ../data/woman.mp4 0

When using it as a part of your program
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What you mostly need are only two files:

> src/params.hpp

> src/prob_model.hpp

Usage is pretty straightforward. Simply init, motion compensate, and update.
